Description: Classification using Richard A. Harshman's Parallel Factors (Parafac) model fit to a 3-way or 4-way data array. Uses Parafac factor weights from one mode of this model as predictors to tune parameters for one or more classification methods. Supports binary and multiclass classification. Predicts class labels or probabilities and calculates multiple classification performance measures. Parallel computing is implemented via the 'parallel' and 'doParallel' packages.
