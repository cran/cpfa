Description: Classification using Richard A. Harshman's Parallel Factor Analysis (Parafac) model-1 fit to a three-way or four-way data tensor/array. See Harshman (1994) <doi:10.1016/0167-9473(94)90132-5>. Uses Parafac factor weights from one mode of this model as predictors to tune parameters for one or more classification methods via a k-fold cross-validation procedure. Supports penalized logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and feed-forward neural network. Supports binary and multiclass classification. Predicts class labels or class probabilities and calculates multiple classification performance measures. Parallel computing is implemented via the 'parallel' and 'doParallel' packages.
