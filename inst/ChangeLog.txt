Changes:  version 1.1-2  (2024-2-15)

1.) Bug fix in main package function tune.cpfa for argument 'nfac'
	- Previously bug prevented argument 'nfac' from containing multiple values
	- Now argument 'nfac' can contain multiple values  

2.) Added a Parafac2 example to help files
	- Previously help files did not include a Parafac2 example
	- Now help files include a Parafac2 example

3.) Bug fix in main package function tune.cpfa for argument 'cmode'
	- Previously could not match 'y' length with classification mode's number of levels
	- Now can match them together correctly

4.) Bug fix in main package function predict.cpfa for argument 'newdata'
	- Previously did not specify array dimensions correctly for four-way arrays
	- Now specifies array dimensions correctly for four-way arrays

5.) Bug fix in main package function predict.cpfa for method 'SVM' for multiclass response
	- Previously columns of SVM predicted probabilities matrix were ordered incorrectly
	- Now columns are ordered correctly, calculating correct performance measures

----------------

Changes:  version 1.1-1  (2024-2-03)

1.) Added help file examples where tensor and response are related
	- Previously examples did not use tensors that were related to responses 
	- Now help file examples use tensors related to responses 

2.) Improved readability of function files
	- Previously code did not contain spaces for clear reading
	- Now adds spaces in function files to improve code readability

----------------

Changes:  version 1.1-0  (2023-12-02)

1.) Bug fix in main package function tune.cpfa
	- Previously a bug prevented Parafac2 models from being fit
	- Now Parafac2 models can be fit correctly

2.) Bug fix in internal package function kcv.plr
	- Previously a bug prevented 'threshold' from working with 'nfolds = 2'
	- Now argument 'threshold' works correctly with 'nfolds = 2'

----------------

Changes:  version 1.0-9  (2023-11-19)

1.) Placed tuning arguments into a list for functions tune.cpfa and cpfa
	- Previously classifier tuning arguments were separate inputs
	- Now combines tuning arguments in a list to improve readability

2.) Added new output to function cpfa
	- Previously optimal tuning parameters were not provided by cpfa
	- Now provides optimal tuning parameters for each replication

----------------

Changes:  version 1.0-8  (2023-10-15)

1.) Bug fix in internal function “kcv.rda” for KCV error calculation
	- Previously provided accuracy as classification error output
	- Now correctly uses classification error instead of accuracy

2.) Improvements to help files for most package functions
	- Previously help files contained language noting four methods
	- Now help files correctly reference five methods, including RDA

3.) Added plotting to main package function cpfa
	- Previously function cpfa contained no plotting capabilities
	- Now box plots of performance measures can be produced as output

----------------

Changes:  version 1.0-7  (2023-10-07)

1.) Added regularized discriminant analysis (RDA) as a classifier
	- Previously used four classification methods
	- Now adds RDA as a new classification method

2.) Added new references to help files for RDA

----------------

Changes:  version 1.0-6  (2023-09-07)

1.) Added Parallel Factor Analysis-2 (Parafac2) as a component model
	- Previously used only Parallel Factor Analysis-1 (Parafac)
	- Now includes functionality for Parafac2 and for irregular tensors

2.) Added new references for Parafac2 (e.g., Harshman, 1972)

----------------

Changes:  version 1.0-5  (2023-08-07)

1.) Added new function ‘cpfa’ as a wrapper function to implement method
	- Previously package functions were not united 
	- Now new wrapper function unites package functions

2.) Improvements to help files
	- Previously help files contained language errors and typos
	- Now help files correctly use proper language

----------------

Changes:  version 1.0-4  (2022-06-20)

1.) Removed package vignette due to vignette still containing key errors
	- Previously provided a vignette describing package use
	- Now removes vignette due to major errors; will add a later date

----------------

Changes:  version 1.0-3  (2022-06-16)
